My first use of gatsby was for my page dedicated to my work as a composer, which can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.timsandberg.com/\" title=\"https://www.timsandberg.com/\">https://www.timsandberg.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>You might notice that this website is a lot more stripped down. Like, a LOT more stripped down. My composer site is meant to be cinematic, so it's <em>pretty extra</em>. I used threejs, a wrapper for webgl, and even wrote custom shaders for the music visualization. Oh, and there's a media player UI. What have I done..</p>\n<p>Since I've got the other website to scratch my itch for flare, I'm hoping to keep this site simple and to-the-point so I can focus on actually writing some content now and then.</p>\n<p>In brief, this site uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com\" title=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com\">Gatsby</a> as a static site generator.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forestry.io/\" title=\"https://forestry.io/\">Forestry</a> as a CMS for a nice writing experience.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\" title=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> and <a href=\"https://react-bootstrap.github.io/\" title=\"https://react-bootstrap.github.io/\">react-bootstrap</a> for basic styling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since this is my second site built with Gatsby and Forestry, I've developed something of a well-beaten path which I hope to write a guide for in my next post.</p>\n<p>For now I'll just say: welcome!</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing: this blog","date":"January 4, 2022","tags":["javascript","static website","react","gatsby"],"image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"blog/welcome"}},
