This website was my second rodeo building a website with Gatsby.js. My first use of gatsby was for my page dedicated to my work as a composer, which can be found here: [https://www.timsandberg.com/](https://www.timsandberg.com/ "https://www.timsandberg.com/").

You might notice that this website is a lot more stripped down. Like, a LOT more stripped down. My composer site is meant to be cinematic, so it's pretty extra.

This website, by contrast, is meant to be a shining example of simplicity. It comes after years of observing other programmer's personal sites and blogs, and how great it can be when there are minimal bells and whistles, and just good, to-the-point content.

### Why Gatsbyjs?

To keep this brief, I'll just link to this sexy marketing page [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/why-gatsby/](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/why-gatsby/ "https://www.gatsbyjs.com/why-gatsby/"). In particular I've been drawn to gatsby for the following reasons

* Graphql interface for all content in site keeps data organized and easy to sort, filter, and query.
* Automated image processing (have you noticed the loading placeholders as you click around the site?).
* The freedom to build and style the site just as you would an SPA in reactjs.
* Really easy to hook into some great free CMS systems, I'll be discussing how I use [https://forestry.io/](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry") for this site.

I will admit it's probably the most DIY and configuration-heavy framework. That being said there are some great pre-made [gatsby starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/ "Gatsby Starters") that can be customized or at least tinkered with so you can see how things are done.

Without further ado...
