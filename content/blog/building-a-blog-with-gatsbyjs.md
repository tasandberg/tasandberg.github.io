This website was my second rodeo building a website with Gatsby.js. My first use of gatsby was for my page dedicated to my work as a composer, which can be found here: [https://www.timsandberg.com/](https://www.timsandberg.com/ "https://www.timsandberg.com/").

You might notice that this website is a lot more stripped down. Like, a LOT more stripped down. My composer site is meant to be cinematic, so it's pretty extra.

This website, by contrast, is meant to be a shining example of simplicity. It comes after years of observing other programmer's personal sites and blogs, and how great it can be when there are minimal bells and whistles, and just good, to-the-point content.

In brief, this site uses:

* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com "https://www.gatsbyjs.com") as a static site generator.
* [Forestry](https://forestry.io/ "https://forestry.io/") as a CMS for a nice writing experience.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "https://getbootstrap.com/") and [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/ "https://react-bootstrap.github.io/") for basic styling

Since this is my second site built with Gatsby and Forestry, I've developed something of a well-beaten path which I hope to write a guide for in my next post.

For now I'll just say: welcome!
