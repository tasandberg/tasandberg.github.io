This is a tutorial for anyone wishing to build a free, CMS-powered blog using Gatsbyjs, Github, and Forestry. Some benefits of this approach are:

* Free hosting on github pages.
* Lovely blog-writing experience using a CMS text editor, with integrated media library.
* Build the site layout in react and sass with built-in hot reloading.

Here is a streamlined tutorial for building and deploying a blog in GatsbyJS, leaving room for your own customization and styling.

Gatsby's documentation is fantastic and thorough, but I always find I have to cherry pick across many different documents and repository README's to figure out seemingly basic things so I thought I'd offer a tutorial of how I've gone about it.

OK, here's the game plan:

Part 1 (this post):

* Gatsby init, basic setup.
* Importing bootstrap
* Site and SEO configuration
* Writing blog posts in markdown and displaying them using Gatsby's graphql data layer.
* Blogpost images using `gatsby-remark-images`
* Publish to github pages
* Other hosting options

Part 2:

* Connecting your blog with Forestry CMS
* Beyond blog-posts: CMS editors are nice! Let's use them for more than blog posts.
* ???
* Publishing from Forestry (Github action)

# Basic setup

Gatsby makes this _pretty_ easy for you. We're going to use the gatsby-default-starter because it provides some really good boiler plate.

```bash
npx gatsby new tutorial-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
```

_Note: "tutorial-blog" will be the name of the site and the directory. This can all be changed later but you may choose to replace it in this command with your own project name._

_Note on gatsby starters: I've found most of the_ [_gatsby starters_](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/ "https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/") _to be impractical for actually building on top of, but they are great to look through for examples of configuration._

You can now `cd` into your new directory and run `npm run develop` to see your site on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000 "http://localhost:8000").

Tada ðŸŽ‰:

Opening the directory in your text editor, you should see a similar structure to this:

![](/src/images/screen-shot-2022-01-05-at-10-49-53-am.png)

_Note: if you use yarn instead of npm like me, you can remove the package-lock.json file and run `yarn` to initialize a yarn.lock file. I'll be using yarn commands for the rest of the tutorial so I don't confuse myself, but of course npm works just as well._

Now lets change a bunch of stuff.

# Configuration

Here we'll just run through some initial basic config, which should serve as a little tour of important places in your gatsby project.

```javascript
// <root>/gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Timmehs' Tutorial Blog`, // <-- Change
    description: `A blog tutorial using Gatsbyjs, Github, and Forestry CMS`, // <-- Change
    author: `Tim Sandberg`, // <-- Change
    siteUrl: `https://timmehs.github.io/tutorial-blog`, // <-- Change
  },
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`,
    `gatsby-plugin-image`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `images`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/images`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    // Delete `gatsby-plugin-manifest` entry
  ],
}
```

### Post-init Cleanup

I'm going to say that PWA features are outside of the scope of this tutorial, so go ahead and delete the gatsby-plugin-manifest entry at the bottom. While we're at it you can `yarn remove gatsby-plugin-manifest gatsby-plugin-offline`. You can read more about those here: [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-manifest/](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-manifest/ "https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-manifest/").

You'll notice a couple pages in the starter are examples for some neat features: server-side-rendered pages ([SSR](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/rendering-options/server-side-rendering/ "Server Side Rendering")) and deferred static generation ([DSG](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/rendering-options/deferred-static-generation/ "Deferred Static Generation")). Gonna give those the `OUT OF SCOPE` stamp as well, so lets delete the following files:

    gatsby-ssr.js
    src/templates/gatsby-dsg.js
    src/pages/using-ssr.js
    src/pages/using-typescript.tsx

Since we're deleting the dsg template, we'll need to remove this code so it doesn't try and make a page out of it:

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js
// We'll return to this file later, so just delete the inner lines
exports.createPages = async ({ actions }) => {
  // DELETE ME:
  // const { createPage } = actions
  // createPage({
  //   path: "/using-dsg",
  //   component: require.resolve("./src/templates/using-dsg.js"),
  //   context: {},
  //   defer: true,
  // })
}
```

With those changes, and the updates to your `siteMetadata` in `gatsby-config.js` you should see some changes on your page (after a server restart):

![](/src/images/default-starter-updated-sn.png)

Your layout component is grabbing that updated info using graphql and plugging it into the Header component. Here's that query shown here on line 11:

```javascript
// src/components/layout.js

import * as React from "react"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby"

import Header from "./header"
import "./layout.css"

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query SiteTitleQuery {
      site {
        siteMetadata {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  `)
  ...
```

You'll also notice the title of the page in the browser tab has updated, this is because the SEO component does the same thing. I like to refactor the Seo component to live within the Layout, but for simplicity's sake let's continue with what we have here.

# Styles

This is getting wordy so I'm going to keep explanation to a minimum here:

```bash
# Install packages
yarn install bootstrap react-bootstrap sass

# Remove old stylesheet
rm src/components/layout.css

# Create new styles directory and scss stylesheet
mkdir src/styles
touch src/styles/bootstrap.scss
```

Update style import in layout.js

```javascript
// src/components/layout.js
import * as React from "react"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby"

import Header from "./header"
// import "./layout.css" delete
import "../styles/bootstrap.scss"
```

Customize and import bootstrap:

```scss
// src/styles/bootstrap.scss

/** 
 * Bootstrap Overrides
 * https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_variables.scss
 */
$font-size-root: 20px;

/**
 * Bootstrap
 * */
@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss";
```
