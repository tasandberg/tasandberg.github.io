This is a tutorial for anyone wishing to build a free, CMS-powered blog using Gatsbyjs, Github, and Forestry. Some benefits of this approach are:

- Free hosting on github pages.
- Lovely blog-writing experience using a CMS text editor, with integrated media library.
- Build the site layout in react and sass with built-in hot reloading.

Here is a streamlined tutorial for building and deploying a blog in GatsbyJS, leaving room for your own customization and styling.

Gatsby's documentation is fantastic and thorough, but I always find I have to cherry pick across many different documents and repository README's to figure out seemingly basic things so I thought I'd offer a tutorial of how I've gone about it.

OK, here's the game plan:

Part 1 (this post):

- Basic setup.
- Styles and bootstrap
- Site and SEO configuration
- Writing blog posts in markdown and displaying them using Gatsby's graphql data layer.

# Basic setup

Gatsby makes this _pretty_ easy for you. We're going to use the gatsby-default-starter because it provides some really good boiler plate for things like Seo, Layout, and Header components.

```bash
npx gatsby new tutorial-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
```

You can now `cd` into your new directory and run `npm run develop` to see your site on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000 "http://localhost:8000").

Tada ðŸŽ‰:

![](/src/images/gatsby-default-starter-sn.png)

Opening the directory in your text editor, you should see a similar structure to this:

![](/src/images/screen-shot-2022-01-05-at-10-49-53-am.png)

Now lets change a bunch of stuff.

# Configuration

Here we'll just run through some initial basic config, which should serve as a little tour of important places in your gatsby project.

**gatsby-config.js**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Timmehs' Tutorial Blog`, // <-- Change
    description: `A blog tutorial using Gatsbyjs, Github, and Forestry CMS`, // <-- Change
    author: `Tim Sandberg`, // <-- Change
    siteUrl: `https://timmehs.github.io/tutorial-blog`, // <-- Change
  },
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`,
    `gatsby-plugin-image`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `images`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/images`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    // Delete `gatsby-plugin-manifest` entry
  ],
}
```

With those changes, and the updates to your `siteMetadata` in `gatsby-config.js` you should see some changes on your page (after a server restart):

![Updated screenshot](/src/images/default-starter-updated-sn.png)

Your layout component is grabbing that updated info using graphql and plugging it into the Header component. Here's that query shown here:

```javascript
// src/components/layout.js

import * as React from "react"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby"

import Header from "./header"
import "./layout.css"

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query SiteTitleQuery {
      site {
        siteMetadata {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  `)
  ...
```

You'll also notice the title of the page in the browser tab has updated, this is because the SEO component does the same thing. I like to refactor the Seo component to live within the Layout, but for simplicity's sake let's continue with what we have here.

### Some boilerplate cleanup

---

_Note: You can let these files and packages be if you want to explore them later, but we wont discuss them in this tutorial_

---

Run

```shell
yarn remove gatsby-plugin-manifest gatsby-plugin-offline
```

Delete the following files:

```shell
gatsby-ssr.js
src/templates/gatsby-dsg.js
src/pages/using-ssr.js
src/pages/using-typescript.tsx
```

Since we're deleting the dsg template, we'll need to remove this code so it doesn't try and make a page out of it:

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js
// We'll return to this file later, so just delete the inner lines

exports.createPages = async ({ actions }) => {
  // DELETE ME:
  // const { createPage } = actions
  // createPage({
  //   path: "/using-dsg",
  //   component: require.resolve("./src/templates/using-dsg.js"),
  //   context: {},
  //   defer: true,
  // })
}
```

You can read up on these removed items here, but I've deemed them out of scope for this tutorial:

- [DSG](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/rendering-options/deferred-static-generation/ "Deferred Static Generation")
- [SSR](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/rendering-options/server-side-rendering/ "Server Side Rendering")
- [PWA/Offline Features](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-manifest/ "Gatsby Plugin manifest")

# Styles

Add sass and bootstrap to your project. I'll use components from react-bootstrap later on, so best not to skip.

Run

```bash
# Install packages
yarn install bootstrap react-bootstrap sass gatsby-plugin-sass

# Remove old stylesheet
rm src/components/layout.css

# Create new styles directory and scss stylesheet
mkdir src/styles
touch src/styles/bootstrap.scss
```

Add gatsby-plugin-sass to plugins:

**gatsby-config.js**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    ...
  },
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-sass`, // <-- New
    `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`,
    `gatsby-plugin-image`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `images`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/images`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
  ],
}
```

Update style import in layout.js

**src/components/layout.js**

```javascript
import * as React from "react"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby"

import Header from "./header"
// import "./layout.css" delete
import "../styles/bootstrap.scss"
```

Customize and import bootstrap:

**src/styles/bootstrap.scss**

```scss
/** 
 * Bootstrap Overrides - full list of customizable variables here:
 * - https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_variables.scss
 * This is my preferred method of customizing bootstrap themes.
 */
$primary: #496257;

/**
 * Bootstrap
 * */
@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss";
```

To make sure it's working, and our styles are hooked up, lets restart the server and check that everything works at http://localhost:8000.

MMmm, bootstrappy.

# Site structure and navigation

With react-bootstrap, our header component can be simply refactored into a responsive nav header which collapses to a dropdown for mobile screens.

![](/src/images/bootstrap-navbar-sn.png)

**src/components/header.js**

```javascript
import * as React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"
import { Container, Nav, Navbar } from "react-bootstrap"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"

const links = [
  { text: "Blog", to: "/blog" },
  { text: "About", to: "/about" },
]

const Header = ({ siteTitle }) => (
  <Navbar bg="primary" expand="lg" variant="dark">
    <Container fluid="lg">
      <Navbar.Brand to="/" as={Link}>
        {siteTitle}
      </Navbar.Brand>
      <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav" />
      <Navbar.Collapse id="basic-navbar-nav">
        <Nav className="ms-auto">
          {links.map(({ text, to }) => (
            <Link
              key={`header-link-${to}`}
              className="nav-link"
              activeClassName="active"
              to={to}
            >
              {text}
            </Link>
          ))}
        </Nav>
      </Navbar.Collapse>
    </Container>
  </Navbar>
)

Header.propTypes = {
  siteTitle: PropTypes.string,
}

export default Header
```

_Note: As with any bootstrap classes or react-bootstrap components used in this tutorial, you can read up on customization options at their respective websites:_

- [_https://react-bootstrap.github.io_](https://react-bootstrap.github.io "https://react-bootstrap.github.io")
- [_https://getbootstrap.com/_](https://getbootstrap.com/ "https://getbootstrap.com/")

---

Next let's update our `index.js` and add the two other pages linked to in our new navbar.

**src/pages/index.js**

```javascript
import * as React from "react"

import Layout from "../components/layout"
import Seo from "../components/seo"

const IndexPage = () => (
  <Layout>
    <Seo title="Home" />
    <h1>Welcome to Timmehs' Tutorial Blog</h1>
    <p>We've got all things that are good.</p>
  </Layout>
)

export default IndexPage
```

**src/pages/blog.js (new)**

```javascript
import * as React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/layout"
import Seo from "../components/seo"

const BlogPage = () => (
  <Layout>
    <Seo title="Blog" />
    <h1>Blog</h1>
    {/* Blog posts will go here */}
  </Layout>
)

export default BlogPage
```

**src/pages/about.js (new)**

```javascript
import * as React from "react"

import Layout from "../components/layout"
import Seo from "../components/seo"

const AboutPage = () => (
  <Layout>
    <Seo title="About" />
    <section>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        This blog is built with Gatsbyjs, Bootstrap, and Forestry. It is the
        demo for the tutorial found here:{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/Timmehs/tutorial-blog">repo</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
  </Layout>
)

export default AboutPage
```

As you will see, any files under the `src/pages` directory are automatically turned into pages in your website by gatsby.

---

_Note: As you click around via the header navigation, you may notice that navigation is super snappy. That's because we're using Gatsby's `<Link />` component, which has some magic to it (more on that_ [_here_](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-link/ "https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-link/")_)._

# Blog posts from markdown

This is the standard static-site-generator functionality we're all here for. The plumbing basically works like this:

- **gatsby-transformer-remark** is a plugin we'll add that will transform markdown files into data nodes with frontmatter and html.
- We'll query for these nodes in our blog index to show a list of them to navigate to.
- We'll create a specially named template file name `src/pages/blog/{MarkdownRemark.parent__(File)__name}.js` that will automatically create blog post pages using the jsx template inside.

Sound like a lot? Well it is, kind of. Let's get started!

## Config for blog posts

Install gatsby-transformer-remark to your project.

**run**

```shell
yarn add gatsby-transformer-remark
```

Add a new gatsby-source-filesystem block and the gatsby-transformer-remark plugin

**gatsby-config.js**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    ...
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `posts`,
        path: `${__dirname}/content/blog`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
	...
  ],
}
```

## Adding blog posts

Create content folder and two blog post files. Adding blogposts after connecting a CMS will be much more convenient, but we're still in the nuts and bolts.

**run**

```shell
# from project root
mkdir content/
touch content/my-first-post.md content/my-second-post.md
```

---

_Note the top section is surrounded above and below by the `---` characters, this tells remark that these fields are frontmatter, separate from the body of the post. You can add any fields here you like, and they will be filterable in graphql._

---

**content/blog/my-first-post.md**

```markdown
---
title: My first post
date: 2022-01-05
---

# Hello, blog!

This is my first post made with markdown.
As you can see I can do cool things like

## Headers

### Headers

#### Headers

- and
- also
- lists
```

**content/blog/my-second-post.md**

```markdown
    ---
    title: My second post
    date: 2022-01-06
    ---

    # Me again

    Really I just made this post to prove I could.
```

## Listing blog posts at /blog

Here we add a page query to our `blog.js` page to grab basic information about our posts and list it.

**src/pages/blog.js**

```javascript
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import * as React from "react"
import { Card, Row } from "react-bootstrap"
import Layout from "../components/layout"
import Seo from "../components/seo"

const BlogPage = ({ data }) => (
  <Layout>
    <Seo title="Blog" />
    <h1>Blog</h1>
    {data.posts.nodes.map(({ id, frontmatter }) => (
      <Card key={id} className="mb-3">
        <Card.Body>
          <Card.Title>{frontmatter.title}</Card.Title>
          <Card.Subtitle>{frontmatter.date}</Card.Subtitle>
        </Card.Body>
      </Card>
    ))}
  </Layout>
)

export const query = graphql`
  {
    posts: allMarkdownRemark {
      nodes {
        id
        frontmatter {
          title
          date(formatString: "LL")
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

export default BlogPage
```

With that, we have a blog index!

![](/src/images/blog-index.png)

## Prototyping Queries

Make sure to leverage the graphql tool on [http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql "http://localhost:8000/___graphql") whenever you need to prototype a query. It's also a great place to poke around and see how Gatsby creates the data layer. Here's a screenshot from me prototyping this particular query, it even gives you code to copy:

![](/src/images/graphiql.png)

## Define a blog post template

Now we create a specially named file under `src/pages` that contains a template for our blog posts. Create a directory named `src/pages/blog`. This will namespace our blog posts to the `/blog` route. Then create a file _carefully_ named:

```shell
src/pages/blog/{MarkdownRemark.parent__(File)__name}.js
```

This tells Gatsby to generate a page for all MarkdownRemark nodes (all of our .md files) at the route `blog/<file name>`. Read up on more capabilities of the File system route API here: [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/ "https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/")

Lets make our actual template in that file.

**`src/pages/blog/{MarkdownRemark.parent__(File)__name}.js`**

```javascript
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../../components/layout"
import Seo from "../../components/seo"
import { graphql, Link } from "gatsby"

export default function BlogPost({ data }) {
  const { frontmatter, html } = data.post

  return (
    <Layout>
      <Seo title="Blogpost" />
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <p>{frontmatter.date}</p>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />
      <Link to="/blog">Back to Blog Home</Link>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query ($id: String!) {
    post: markdownRemark(id: { eq: $id }) {
      frontmatter {
        title
        date(formatString: "LL")
      }
      html
    }
  }
`
```

Now if you visit [http://localhost:8000/blog/my-first-post](http://localhost:8000/blog/my-first-post "http://localhost:8000/blog/my-first-post") you should see your post, all nicely formatted. Well OK, the formatting needs work but you've got bootstrap installed and waiting to be leveraged.

## Link to posts from the blog index

Update out blog.js page to link the blog title the the post itself:

```javascript
// Add "Link" to imports from gatsby
import { graphql, Link } from "gatsby"

...

const BlogPage = ({ data }) => (
  ...
    ...
    <Card.Title>
      // Wrap the title text in a Gatsby Link component
      <Link to={`/blog/${parent.name}`}>{frontmatter.title}</Link>
    </Card.Title>
    ...
  ...
)

// Update the query to get the file name for the post
export const query = graphql`
  {
    posts: allMarkdownRemark {
      nodes {
        id
        frontmatter {
          title
          date(formatString: "LL")
        }
        parent {
          ... on File {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

export default BlogPage
```

# You're done!

This post is now a massive monstrosity so I will leave it here.

In the next post we'll cover:

- publishing to github pages
- connecting with ForestryIO CMS
- Managing multiple content types
