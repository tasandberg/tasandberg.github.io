This website was my second rodeo building a website with Gatsby.js. My first use of gatsby was for my page dedicated to my work as a composer, which can be found here: [https://www.timsandberg.com/](https://www.timsandberg.com/ "https://www.timsandberg.com/").

You might notice that this website is a lot more stripped down. Like, a LOT more stripped down. My composer site is meant to be cinematic, so it's _pretty extra_. I used threejs, a wrapper for webgl, and even wrote custom shaders for the music visualization. Oh, and there's a media player UI. What have I done..

Since I've got the other website to scratch my itch for flare, I'm hoping to keep this site simple and to-the-point so I can focus on actually writing some content now and then.

In brief, this site uses:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com "https://www.gatsbyjs.com") as a static site generator.
- [Forestry](https://forestry.io/ "https://forestry.io/") as a CMS for a nice writing experience.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "https://getbootstrap.com/") and [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/ "https://react-bootstrap.github.io/") for basic styling

Since this is my second site built with Gatsby and Forestry, I've developed something of a well-beaten path which I hope to write a guide for in my next post.

For now I'll just say: welcome!
