My composer homepage, portfolio, and blog. Built with GatsbyJS. The website features a full-page animated music visualizer, as well as a custom media player written in react.

The landing page was a juicy project, completed in the fall of 2021. The visualization was created by creating two collections of particles, one set serves as the ambient texture, placing particles at random in 3d space around the camera. The other, more conspicuous particle system is the one which drifts across the screen.

The colors, speed, and size of the particles are determined by the current frequency spectrum of the music. The color sets of the particles changes when the track is changed using the media player.
