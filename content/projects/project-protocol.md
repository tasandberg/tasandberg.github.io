A downloadable app that servers as a parole officer rating
tool. Data is publicly visible yet anonymously submitted.
This crowdsourced community feedback app aims to produce a more
equitable relationship between officers and the people
under their supervision by allowing those on parole to have
transparency into the most critical relationship of their
re-entry.
