Joining this team focused on criminal justice reform, I inherited a small react-native prototype. I fleshed this out
with it's own design system and component library and took it to a fully fledged mobile app, which is now (early 2022) in beta for
both Android and iOS, backed by an API written in ruby on rails.

Drawing from my experience working alongside some fantastic
DevOps engineers in the past, I architected and implement
fully automated CI for testing and deployment for both the mobile app
and the API server.
