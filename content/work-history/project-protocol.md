A downloadable app that servers as a parole officer rating
tool. Data is publicly visible yet anonymously submitted.
This crowdsourced community feedback app aims to produce a more
equitable relationship between officers and the people
under their supervision by allowing those on parole to have
transparency into the most critical relationship of their
re-entry.

Drawing from my experience working alongside some fantastic
DevOps engineers in the past, I architected and implement
fully automated CI for testing and deployment for both the mobile app
and the API server.
