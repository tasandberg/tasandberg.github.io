End-to-end architecture and implementation of a wide range of features on the Bugcrowd platform, with emphasis on scaling operations, improving user efficiency, and improving application performance for users around the world. Closely collaborated with stakeholders and design to ensure our work had the greatest possible impact.

Throughout my time at Bugcrowd I had the opportunity to lead a number of projects and teams. This gave me tremendous opportunities to grow in the areas of project management and delivery, as well as code design, architecture, and mentorship.
